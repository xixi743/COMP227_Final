Sqorls! 

It's the spring semester of 2020 at Occidental College (also known as Oxy). We're
unwillingly living through a historic event: the coronavirus pandemic. The school
has been evacuated - students sent home, professors working remotely. A small group
of staff remains to run essential services... and you. You have been permitted to
remain in the school dorms due to the lack of housing at home. The school begins
to change with its grounds abandoned. The trash cans are overflowing with the sudden
departure of the school's residents. However, the food in the trash can quickly disappears.
The campus sqorls are HUNGRY. Ravenous for more, the sqorls start to attack the school
in search of food. They hunt each building with the goal to feed their rapidly growing
families. You are the last of the few remaining students at Oxy and it is up to you
to save the school from nature's ruin.
